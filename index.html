            <h2>Why San Francisco?</h2>
            <h3>The city of forty-eight hills</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>San Francisco</strong> is a vibrant city that offers a
              unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're fascinated by history, food, technology, nature, or
              art, San Francisco has something to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may measure less than 50 square miles and have a population
              that doesn’t even crack a million, but San Francisco justly ranks
              as one of the greatest cities in the world. Famous for grand-dame
              Victorians, cable cars, a dynamic waterfront, and a soaring golden
              bridge, this city truly has it all. With trend-defining cuisine
              ranging from Michelin-starred dining to outrageous food trucks;
              world-renowned symphony, ballet, theater, and opera; plus almost
              boundless outdoor adventures, San Francisco justifiably stands out
              as one of the ultimate must-visit cities on any traveler’s wish
              list.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hardest part may be deciding where to go first. (Well, that
              and packing for the city’s famously unpredictable weather.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite its famously steep hills, San Francisco is remarkably easy
              to get around. Clanging cable cars are beloved icons and a
              convenient way to travel between the waterfront and Union Square.
              Historic streetcars run along the Embarcadero with stops for
              Fisherman’s Wharf, the Ferry Building Marketplace, and Oracle
              Park, home of the Major League’s Giants baseball team. For an
              easy, affordable ride, look for one of hundreds of bikeshare
              stations and hop on a Bay Wheels bike (or ebike) and go.

                <h4>Alamo Square</h4>
                <p>
                  Alamo Square is a residential neighborhood in San Francisco,
                  California with a park of the same name. Is characterized by
                  Victorian architecture that was left largely untouched by the
                  urban renewal projects in other parts of the Western Addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The neighborhood's focal point and namesake, consists of four
                  city blocks at the top of a hill overlooking much of downtown
                  San Francisco, with a number of large and architecturally
                  distinctive mansions along the perimeter, including the
                  "Painted Ladies", a well-known postcard motif.
                </p>
                <p>The "Painted Ladies", are often shown in the foreground of panoramic pictures of the city's downtown area. A number of movies, television shows and commercials have been filmed in or around Alamo Square. </p>

                <p>
                  The Castro District, commonly referred to as the Castro, is a neighborhood in Eureka Valley in San Francisco. The Castro was one of the first gay neighborhoods in the United States. It remains one of the most prominent symbols of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activism and events in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Haight-Ashbury is a district of San Francisco, California, named for the intersection of Haight and Ashbury streets. It is also called The Haight and The Upper Haight. The neighborhood is known as one of the main centers of the counterculture of the 1960s. Here you can find plenty of second-hand and vintage clothes shops and for those music lovers, this neighborhood is home of Jimmi Hendrix house.

                <h4> South of market "SOMA"</h4>
                <p>
                 South of Market (SoMa) is a neighborhood in San Francisco, California, situated just south of Market Street. It contains several sub-neighborhoods including South Beach, Yerba Buena, and Rincon Hill.
                </p>
                <p>
                  SoMa is home to many of the city's museums, to the headquarters of several major software and Internet companies, and to the Moscone Conference Center.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before being called South of Market this area was called "South of the Slot", a reference to the cable cars that ran up and down Market along the slots through which they gripped cables. While the cable cars have long since disappeared from Market Street, some "old timers" still refer to this area as "South of the Slot".
