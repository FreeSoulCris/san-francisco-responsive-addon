            <h2>Why San Francisco?</h2>
            <h3>The city of forty-eight hills</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>San Francisco</strong> is a vibrant city that offers a
              unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether you're fascinated by history, food, technology, nature, or
              art, San Francisco has something to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may measure less than 50 square miles and have a population
              that doesn’t even crack a million, but San Francisco justly ranks
              as one of the greatest cities in the world. Famous for grand-dame
              Victorians, cable cars, a dynamic waterfront, and a soaring golden
              bridge, this city truly has it all. With trend-defining cuisine
              ranging from Michelin-starred dining to outrageous food trucks;
              world-renowned symphony, ballet, theater, and opera; plus almost
              boundless outdoor adventures, San Francisco justifiably stands out
              as one of the ultimate must-visit cities on any traveler’s wish
              list.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hardest part may be deciding where to go first. (Well, that
              and packing for the city’s famously unpredictable weather.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite its famously steep hills, San Francisco is remarkably easy
              to get around. Clanging cable cars are beloved icons and a
              convenient way to travel between the waterfront and Union Square.
              Historic streetcars run along the Embarcadero with stops for
              Fisherman’s Wharf, the Ferry Building Marketplace, and Oracle
              Park, home of the Major League’s Giants baseball team. For an
              easy, affordable ride, look for one of hundreds of bikeshare
              stations and hop on a Bay Wheels bike (or ebike) and go.
